## Custom Drone Flight Controller
Arduino + MPU9250 based Flight Controller for Quadcopter!
This project is a custom-built quadcopter drone that uses an Arduino flight controller with an MPU9250 IMU. Will use a flight controller written in Arduino C++ with a cascaded PID loop for stabilization!

## 3D Model

This'll be printed in Carbon Fiber Nylon Filament, so it is actually strong enough to be a drone chassis. I will also use a Gyroid infill pattern with 40% infill to make it really strong, and I'll also use a wall count of 6 for further reinforcement.

## Inspiration
This is my hack club project to build a quadcopter from scratch with a custom flight controller with Arduino &amp; MPU9250. Growing up, I'd watch many science and engineering videos online; I've always been a science kid who spends his time watching astronomy, engineering, etc type videos. I did this project to challenge myself in learning the ins and outs of how a quadcopter actually works, and also to combine my skills in hardware, electronics, and coding to create something unique and not just follow a tutorial.

 ## What Makes This Project Unique
Unlike most custom drones that rely on preprogrammed ready-to-fly flight controllers, my project uses a fully custom flight controller using Arduino & mpu9250 that I had to do a lot of research to actually learn how it works using custom cascaded PID controller loops (and in the future, an extended Kalman filter), and I am working on developing it into a fully functioning firmware. Along with that, I am utilizing a novel method to stream video transmission using a USB camera and the Raspberry Pi using a Python script that uses OpenCV to play video on a web dashboard hosted in Flask and streamed with Flask-socketio. This is a unique method as I offload the low-level control to the Arduino, while I implement advanced features such as a camera (and hopefully in the future GPS, ultrasonic sensors, etc) through the more powerful Raspberry Pi, which actually runs the Linux Operating System.
- Arduino --> Does the low-level flight control and sensor fusion
- Raspberry Pi --> Video Streaming
**Note: Using the onboard wifi on the Raspberry Pi does mean the video transmission range is limited, and beyond that range, we have to rely solely on radio.

Note: The ESCs themselves are part of the wiring diagram and are powered by the Arduino. It is crucial to note the motors themselves, and the Arduino also gets power from the main battery. The reason this configuration was required is that the Arduino converts the 11.1V on the 3S battery to 5V and supplies it to the other electronics.
